      <h2>The Purpose of a Readme File</h2>
      <p id="p_readme">
        A readme file is a very important part of any GitHub repository. It is often the first item a visitor will see
        when landing on a repository. A readme file should provide users with information about the purpose of a
        project, how to use it effectively and who the contributers and maintainers of the project are.

        The Purpose of A Wireframe
      </h2>
      <p>
        A wireframe in web design is a basic visual representation of a webpage
        that helps to outline its overall stucture and functionality.
        Wireframes are used early in the development process to demonstrate the basic
        structure of a page before visual design and content are added. The simplicity
        of wireframes allow for changes and iterations to be made quickly and easily.

      <h2>
        What is a Git Branch
      </h2>
      <p>
        A git branch is a pointer to a snapshot of all the changes that occured
        on that branch. Upon creating a new GitHub repository you will usually
        be on the main branch by default. You can create additional branches which
        are like separate workspaces to make changes to a project or test other features
        without compromising the base project. Branches are useful when working
        on a project with many collaborators as each individual can make changes on their own local
        copy of a project and propose their changes to be integrated to the main branch
        after approval.
